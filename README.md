**Robot Design And Competition** : Webot Stimulation of the Proposed Model <br>
Members : **S.SANJITH, M.N.M. NUSHATH, K.KAJHANAN** <br>

***Special Features of the Algorithm***
+ Recursive approach in finding object which allowed to search for the object infinitely many time.
+ Recursive alignment strategy of arm to turn by small angle as to grip the object through feedback.
+ Infinite search algorithm for ball finding.
+ Object shape detection through finely placed four coupled IR sensors.
+ PID control over wall following and line following

Due to the reason of enabling self-collision we stimulated different arm strategy instead of our parallel gripper technique.......
